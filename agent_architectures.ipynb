    "**The Problem: The \"Do-It-All\" Agent**\n",
    "While single agents can accomplish many tasks, they quickly reach limitations as tasks grow in complexity. A monolithic agent that attempts to handle research, writing, editing, and fact-checking simultaneously faces several challenges:\n",
    "- Bloated and confusing instruction prompts\n",
    "- Difficulty in debugging (unclear which part failed)\n",
    "- Maintenance challenges\n",
    "- Higher risk of producing unreliable results\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: A Team of Specialists**\n",
    "Rather than relying on a single agent for every task, a **multi-agent system** employs several specialized agents that work together—just like a collaborative team. Each agent has one clear responsibility (for example, one agent focuses on research, another handles writing). This specialization leads to:\n",
    "- Easier construction and testing of individual agents\n",
    "- Greater reliability and maintainability\n",
    "- Enhanced overall system performance through collaboration\n",
